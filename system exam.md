## anatomy of the cerebellum circuit 

cerebellum has several layers. (i will draw a picture here)

first, starting from the deep, granule layer.
the granule cell bodies are in this layer, and they project to molecular layer and produce parallel fibers there.
inferior olive has projections end at cerebellar nuclear cell here.
mossy fibers connect to granule cells.
the cerebellar nuclei cells project to brainstem and thalamus, also some neurons there project to inf olive.

second, cerebellum cortex layer.
here, we have purkingje cell bodies, and their projection from the molecular layer parallel fibers to cell body, then to deep cerebellar nucles.


third, molecular layer.
in the molecular layer, the purkingje cell dentritic tree form synapse with the parallel fibers.
the climbing fiber from inf olive climb on purkingje cells towards the parallel fiber.
there are also basket cells in the molecular layer.

## how spikes generated by the circuit

complex spikes and simple spikes are spikes at purkinje cells.
complex spikes are low frequency, has a boarder peak comparing to simple spikes, and thought to contain information about prediction.
and simple spikes are high frequency and thought to contain relatively less information.

climbing fiber to purkinje cells is a one to many relationship.
when climbing fiber fires, it produce a depolarization to the purkinje cell so that a lot of na comes in, and opens up ca channels and result in a boarder ca spike of the purkingje cell denritic tree.
so, the complex spikes are mostly dependent on the low firing climbing fibers.

its thought that the complex spikes contain the information of the error singal.
the inf olive and other circuits perform this kind of error computation, take the difference between motor signal excuated by the brain to the spinal cord, vs the signal from the spinal cord feedback.
if there is a mismatch, in other words, unexpected errors, the inf olive will fire and results in climbing fiber depolorization and complex spikes in purkinje cells.

another learning pathway is the ltd at parallel fiber to purkinje cell connaction.
when the parallel fiber and climbing fiber activated at the same time, ltd happens.
it is though to be a correcting adjustment, from error signal from complex spikes, and the later simple spikes are althered to correct the behavior/ to learn the behavior.

## difference between complex spikes and simple spikes https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2887989/

the simple spikes are mostly due to mossy fiber input and intrinsic activities.
while the complex spikes are from climbing fibers.
in this case, the climbing fiber complex spikes contains instructivce signal, where the mossy fiber simple spikes contains infomation about other infomation such as integrated sensory inputs.

## meanings of complex and simple spikes in behavior

for example, in a simple tone paired eye blink conditioning motor learning, the cs is the tone and the us is the air puff to the eye.
the response is the blink.

in this case, the sound cue infomation goes to some brain nuclei and finally integrated in the mossy fiber inputs, to granule cells, golgi cells, and to parallel fiber.
this will produce the simple spikes in the purkinje cells.

the air puff cs, will goes to some brain nuclei such as the eye blink reflex center.
besides this, it will also go to inf olive, and the inf olive project to climbing fiber and produce complex spikes in purkinje cells.

before the learning, the cs and us are unpaired.
the inf olive and hearing nuclei activate the cn, and the purkinje cell activated by inf olive inhibit the cn.
because now the mossy fiber input and inf olive inputs are unpaired at purkinje cells, the output blink is sololy relfex from the us.
as the cn produce a motor command spike just as the us time, the animal is not able to predice the coming us from the tone.
also, because the cn is not predicting correctly, the prediction signal is inhibiting the inf olive at wrong time, and inf olive keeps sending error/instructive signal to purkinje cells.

during learning, the cerebellum use the instructive signal from complex spikes from climbing fiber of inf olive, and modify the simple spikes from mossy fiber input from the cs, using basket cells.
as those synapse are updated, the purkinje cell activate cn more and more preciese temporally, now the cn send kind of correct prediction signal to inf olive.
if the prediction is correct, the inhibitory input and the us excititory input are balanced out, meaning no error/instructive signal will be sending to purkinje cell via climbing fiber to make updates.
when the prediction misses, there will be this error signal for update.

after learning, the cs and us are paired.
now, the inf olive will fire at cs.
the cn will send motor command to close the eye at cs, to avoid the us.
