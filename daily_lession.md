### framework
### extended kalman filter 
extended for approximate to a linear relationship.  
### progress
forward env done.  
training an agent overnight  
### todo
read more about [kalman filter](http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/)  
think wrapper  


## 3.11
###  review of framework
belief=r,  o-r-belief, r neural rate code  
belief space is larger than r, need to compress into r  
dynamics of r, need to find r capcture belief  
particle, neuron r represent particle trijectory  
weight, mean, var of trijectory  
hypothesis, populatio, set of particles, or distributions   
node, expeactation, connectin, transition  
particle try to find the hill  
place neuron  


### foraging task, firefly task, and atoms
poison parametrizing resourse
mixture of gaussion, kernel, cover the space  
### kalman filter seems important 
### heoslan matrix? 
when negative, is guassion, when positive, is hyperbo  
### check ppc(linear in log), ppc kalman (alex jeff)
embedding space linear sum  
uncertainty vs sum of r, goes down like 1/r  
cost of r linear increase  
rewrd of r has a peak and then decrease  
the subtract of cost and reward will have a peak, so this is the point that has good result will have a smaller cost  
trade off  
what is lqr? quaratic, no uncertainty?  
uncertainty , response space  
trade off is calcularable  
### progress
figure standard baseline  
### todo
at least know what equations mean  
try fit standard baseline
