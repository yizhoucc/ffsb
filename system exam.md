## anatomy of the cerebellum circuit 

cerebellum has several layers. (i will draw a picture here)

first, starting from the deep, granule layer.
the granule cell bodies are in this layer, and they project to molecular layer and produce parallel fibers there.
inferior olive has projections end at cerebellar nuclear cell here.
mossy fibers connect to granule cells.
the cerebellar nuclei cells project to brainstem and thalamus, also some neurons there project to inf olive.

second, cerebellum cortex layer.
here, we have purkingje cell bodies, and their projection from the molecular layer parallel fibers to cell body, then to deep cerebellar nucles.


third, molecular layer.
in the molecular layer, the purkingje cell dentritic tree form synapse with the parallel fibers.
the climbing fiber from inf olive climb on purkingje cells towards the parallel fiber.
there are also basket cells in the molecular layer.

## how spikes generated by the circuit

complex spikes and simple spikes are spikes at purkinje cells.
complex spikes are low frequency, has a boarder peak comparing to simple spikes, and thought to contain information about prediction.
and simple spikes are high frequency and thought to contain relatively less information.

climbing fiber to purkinje cells is a one to many relationship.
when climbing fiber fires, it produce a depolarization to the purkinje cell so that a lot of na comes in, and opens up ca channels and result in a boarder ca spike of the purkingje cell denritic tree.
so, the complex spikes are mostly dependent on the low firing climbing fibers.

its thought that the complex spikes contain the information of the error singal.
the inf olive and other circuits perform this kind of error computation, take the difference between motor signal excuated by the brain to the spinal cord, vs the signal from the spinal cord feedback.
if there is a mismatch, in other words, unexpected errors, the inf olive will fire and results in climbing fiber depolorization and complex spikes in purkinje cells.

another learning pathway is the ltd at parallel fiber to purkinje cell connaction.
when the parallel fiber and climbing fiber activated at the same time, ltd happens.
it is though to be a correcting adjustment, from error signal from complex spikes, and the later simple spikes are althered to correct the behavior/ to learn the behavior.

## difference between complex spikes and simple spikes 
<!-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2887989/ -->

the simple spikes are mostly due to mossy fiber input and intrinsic activities.
while the complex spikes are from climbing fibers.
in this case, the climbing fiber complex spikes contains instructivce signal, where the mossy fiber simple spikes contains infomation about other infomation such as integrated sensory inputs.

## meanings of complex and simple spikes in behavior

for example, in a simple tone paired eye blink conditioning motor learning, the cs is the tone and the us is the air puff to the eye.
the response is the blink.

in this case, the sound cue infomation goes to some brain nuclei and finally integrated in the mossy fiber inputs, to granule cells, golgi cells, and to parallel fiber.
this will produce the simple spikes in the purkinje cells.

the air puff cs, will goes to some brain nuclei such as the eye blink reflex center.
besides this, it will also go to inf olive, and the inf olive project to climbing fiber and produce complex spikes in purkinje cells.

before the learning, the cs and us are unpaired.
the inf olive and hearing nuclei activate the cn, and the purkinje cell activated by inf olive inhibit the cn.
because now the mossy fiber input and inf olive inputs are unpaired at purkinje cells, the output blink is sololy relfex from the us.
as the cn produce a motor command spike just as the us time, the animal is not able to predice the coming us from the tone.
also, because the cn is not predicting correctly, the prediction signal is inhibiting the inf olive at wrong time, and inf olive keeps sending error/instructive signal to purkinje cells.

during learning, the cerebellum use the instructive signal from complex spikes from climbing fiber of inf olive, and modify the simple spikes from mossy fiber input from the cs, using basket cells.
as those synapse are updated, the purkinje cell activate cn more and more preciese temporally, now the cn send kind of correct prediction signal to inf olive.
if the prediction is correct, the inhibitory input and the us excititory input are balanced out, meaning no error/instructive signal will be sending to purkinje cell via climbing fiber to make updates.
when the prediction misses, there will be this error signal for update.

after learning, the cs and us are paired.
now, the inf olive will fire at cs.
the cn will send motor command to close the eye at cs, to avoid the us.

## single unit recording

using single unit recording, we will have the precies knowledge about the neuron electrophysiology properties.
using electrode, we can measure the exact voltage change vs time.
during recording, we can also inject current and test voltage responses, we can measure capacitance and resistance on different conditions, and we can alter the solutions by changing ion concentrations.
more importantly, we are able to focus on different part of neurons, or specific channels if we like.
in this way, we have very good infomation about how ap is propergation, and how molecules affect the physiology properties of the neuron.

in conclusion, in single neuron recording, a spikes is a spikes, and we see almost everything directly and precisely.
if doing single neuron activities in tissue slice and multiple cells in circuits, we can know precisely how the infomation is computed.
for exmaple, in hippocampus ca1 ca3 and dg circuits, we can record activites in each area, and see how changes in one node affact the down streams.

but usually, a precise single unit recording involves a lot of fine adjustment.
we dont have a lot of data from many cells, nor can we trace the cell through days of experiments.

## lfp recording

lfp recording records the local field potentials.
instead of focusing on single neuron, we look at the neuron populations.
we put the electrode near the cluster of neurons of interest, rather than at the specific neuron.
in this way, we are actually recording many neurons at the same time.
although by doing post analysis, we can kind of projecting the features of different neurons in such a way that allow us to cluster and split the data into units, we are not sure how this unit resembles the real neuron.
in other words, one unit could be a single neuron, it could also be several very similar neurons, or it could be a sepcific type of spikes from a single neuron.

in this way, the strength of lfp recording is not recording many neurons at the same time and recover the single neuron data.
instead, using the lfp recording, we usually use the low pass filter to remove the high frequncy spikes.
after this step, we have the synchronized activities of the neuron population of interest, namely the slow fluctuations, comes from the sustained currents.

in lfp, we can look at the phases, when looking at single unit recording spikes at the same time.
for example, on phase firings and off phase firings may code things differently, as in place cells.
we will know the population level information such as modulation about the circuits.

lfp is also a tool to determine the attention and wakefulness.
for example, from the lfp rythme, we can determine the slow wave sleep, rem sleep, theta rythme, etc.

## calcium imaging

calcium imaging is a good way to see neuron activities as it can record thousands of neurons at the same time, and keep tracking the same neurons over time.

usually, the neurons used in ca imaging are geneticly engineered to express gfp flurophore, so that they bind to the ca ions and signal the ca spikes.
ca spikes is a good representations of the actual action potental on a slower time scale, and this is one drawback of the ca imaging.

with the ca imaging, we can analysis the data of many neurons and check their corelations of each other.
in this way, we determine their functional connectivities instead of physical connectivities.
for example, we can see neuron 1 always fire at the same times at neuron 2, but due to the slow frame rate of the ca imaging, we cannot say for sure that neuron 1 and 2 are physically connected, but they are functionally connected.

in some cases, we can zoom in and see directly how neurons are connected.
we can see the ap through the axons, and goes to another connected neuron.

other than that, because we have the spatial informations of the neurons, we can also see how neurons organize in circuits.
for exmaple, we see in v1 cortex, the neurons are in such an arrangement that nearby neurons responde to similar angle of visual input.

## what is flexor extensor reflex 
<!-- https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/m/s3/chapter02.html -->

### for the second part, explain what is happening at the circuit level. What is happening with excitation or inhibition to modify the reflex? What do you think the descending commands are actually doing, specifically what are they doing to the reflex?

flexor extensor reflex is combining the flexor reflex on one side of the body to retract foot when hitting something painful, with the cross extensor reflex to keep the balance and not fall down.

in the flexor reflex, the pain receptor at foot, let say left foot, goes to the dorsol root ganglion at left side of spinal cord.
then to the motor neurons in ventral horn, which in turn signal teh muscles to get left foot move away from the hazard stimuli.

in the extensor reflex, the sensory neuron from left dorsal root ganglion also project to the motor neurons at right ventral horn, by crossing the midline of the spinal cord.
these motor neurons signal the muscles in the right leg to maintain balance.

## what region producing the command and how comman modifys

the brain descending command can modulate the strength of the reflex.
for example, regarding the flexor reflex, if i need to hold the hot dish and move it to table, the brain motor cortex inhibit the reflex by the corticospinal tract.
as a result, the gain and the threshold of the reflex is decreased, and one can force himself to hold the hot dish for longer.
another example regarding the flexor extensor reflex, if my left foot recieve the harzard stimuli, but my right foot is in such a position that i cannot put my mess centor on right foot to keep balance.
now, i have to force my left foot to stay with the harzard stimuli for a little bit longer, to allow some time for right foot to adjust to a stable location to keep balance and safe.

### you should say what type of gene Foxp2 is. 
### Also, where is it expressed? what happens when the gene is knocked out (in model systems) or mutated (in human)?
### And for the differences, I am trying to get you to be creative to think about how "communication" is processed. 
### need to say how signals are processed in two circuits
### The key is to explain HOW a difference could arise, and this could occur at many level, even just anatomy. 
It might be that homologous regions in bird and human, for example ones that express Foxp2, 
are simply different in anatomy and connectivity such that in birds the circuit is well connected to motor commands and teaching signals 
where in human the foxp2-expressing circuit links "higher-order" regions, 
but with motor circuits for language connected at a lower or accessory level. 

## human language, gene, circuits, patterns of neural activity

human language processing involves complex circuits.
first, the speaking of language is a motor acitivity.
the infomation relay center thalamus recieve sensory and basal ganglia input, and send to prefrontal cortex for cognition, and motor cortex for excution.
more specificly, the important broca area, generate language by control the motor function of speech and language comprehension.
in conclusion, the circuit is: from v1, a1, and other sensory inputs, the infomation integrated in thalamus, and project to croca area and then to motor area for speech.
the song bird has similar circuits, with broca region analogy hvc.

serveral genes are involved in development for language.
for example, foxp2.
the song bird has similar gene.

## bird song, gene, circuits, activity

compare the bird song to human language as a whole, the bird song lacks comphrension.
in other words, the bird song does not include as much infomation as in our language.
the bird song is believe to represent the state of the bird, hollistic, rather than containing logic infomation to communicate.
also, human language has multiple forms of representation, like letters, speech, touch.
the human language also containing grammer.

difference in bird circuits:

the bird learn the song from tutuor, usually his father.
here, the tutor song is heard by coclear and transmitt to some processing nucleus.
then, in primary a1, the information is projected to nif, then to hvc, the broca area analogy.
the hvc project to basal ganlia circuits for rehearsal and learning, and song is produced by hvc via some motor nuclus.

neural activities?
im not sure about this. do you mean the neural activity pattern that is coorespoding to the circuit design?
or the neural activity pattern relationship with the actual language and song?

## affect brain region of pd 

in pd, several brain region is affected.
including the basal ganglia region, which is responsible for activate/inhibit motor circuits.

<!-- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627319302119 -->

in a normal no pd condition, the substantia nigra signals the striatum and activate direct pathway while inhibit the indirect pathway.
the globus pallidus is then inhibited by these effect.
because the globus pallidus has inhibitory connection to thalamus and cortex, if the globus pallidus is inhibited, the total effect is promoting the movement.
in conclusion, the whole system provides an action selection process.
the wanted action is encouraged, and the unwanted action is suppressed.

in a pd patient, becaues the degeneration of the substantia nigra dopamine neurons, the total effect is a inhibition on thalamus and cortex, resulting in suppression the movement.
the brain loss the dopamine signal to fine control the motor activity, and lost motivation to move.

## how a prosthetic can work for pd

in pd, the motor cortex does not generate enough spikes as in normal condition.
so, standard prosthetic that rely on decoding the motor cortex will not work.

a direct way would be mimicing the dopamine's effect by stimulation the direct pathway and inhibit the indirect pathway by electrodes.
this is similar as giving the l dopa to the patients, where the l dopa is turned into dopamine in the brain and to some extend the motor function is restored.

a another way would be trying to decode the action intention while use the standard prothetic arms.
studies have shown that the premotor cortex and parietal cortex which are encoding the movement intention, are lessly affacted.
some other studies showed that the premotor cortex are overly activated than normal.
from a sufficient infomation perspective, decoding from an information rich source with noise is always better than decoding from source that does not contain enough information.
from a neural science perspective, the motor cortex encodes relativaly direct movement commands while the premotor areas contains more of the prepatory activites, and intention.
in this way, even though the premotor cortex is kind of overly activated in pd patients, we could use this movement intention to decode actions, and construct the prothetics.
some filters might be needed to remove the overly activated part of the premotor cortex signals.
here, it is like we use a jump wire to short cut the basal ganglia action selective process.
instead of rely on the basla ganglia, we have to implant something else to select the wanted action and suppress the unwanted action.
as the action selection model discussed in class, the unwanted action is a guassian distribution around the actual wanted action.
if so, or if the unwanted action has some parameterized distribution, such as tremor, we can easily extract the actual wanted action from the premotor cortex decoding.
thus, we can achieve a potential prosthetics by decoding at premotor areas for pd patients.

side notes:
in my perspective, the overly activated part of premotor cortex activity might due to brain adjustment for a not responding motor cortex.
if so, the premotor cortex actually contain stronger signal for movement intention, and provide better decoding potentially, and no filter is needed.
