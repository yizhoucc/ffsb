## q1

### a

transporters
receptors
signal pathways
transcription factors
ligases

### b?

by giving the drug that bind to GABA receptor, the seizure is controled.

### c

the scn1a gene is coding for sodium channel that critical to ap propagation in some interneurons.
if the patient has abnormal functional scn1a, we should not give durgs that acting on ca channels ro ampa receptors as they will have no effect.

### d

could use aav to insert the correct copy of the scn1a gene selectively to the inhibitory interneourns that need functional scn1a copy.

## q2

### a

because of the mutation in this ca channel, less ca is entering the cell and there's less ampa.
this causes less synaptic transmission and an abnormal early firing patterns.
the abnormal firing pattern will make the other neurons rebound soon after, and casuing seizures.

### b

stimulate the neurons similar as the rebound current.
and see if this rebound current is suffcient to reproduce the seizure neuron activity.

# MS https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5450788/

## q3?

the ms will result in plagues/lesions, inflammation, and demyleinating.
demyleinated axon, this is the initial sign of the ms.
the causes and mechanism is not fully studied, but the results is, the axon mylein sheath is breaking down.
plaques, the oligo cells are unable to fully repair the demyleinated axons, and this plaque build up during this break down of waste process.
inflammation, the immune cells is over activated and attact the myleinated axon.

the treatment is usually involve with reduce the inflammation first.
durgs of corticosteroid can reduce the inflammation.
pro, its a easy treatment, durgs can be taken orally.
con, the treatment has sides effect, and it does not act on restoring the normal function of the neural system by putting mylein back.

treatment, targeting on reducing demyleination, drugs that supress the immune system activity and reduce the immune cell level can be used to stop the progress of the ms.
with less misfunctional immune cells, less mylein is attacted and the process is slowed.
pro, the treatment can slow down the progress of the ms
con, the treatment does not restore the normal neuronal activity, as it only slow down the progess.

# TBI

## q4

### a?

3 process, axotomy, ischemia, and inflammation.

first, revascularization, we should target to restore the normal vascularization.
the revascularization will reduce the hypoxia and provide essential nutriants to the neuron for self heal process.
second, neuroprotection, we should target on preventing the neurons to suffer from secondary injury such as inflammation.
third, restore the neural function by plasicity.
the dead neurons cannot regenerate, but other neurons could take the place the dead neurons.
it is important to retrain those neurons to perform normal activities.

### q5

injury on brain has delayed injury.
injury on brain cause neuron death that is not invertiable.
injury on brai causes more complex outcomes.
injury on brain causes hypoxia, potentially.

# tumor

## q6

the gliomas are stems cells, or stem like cells.
they have properties such as self renewal, and could give rise to multiple cell types.
the gliomas must have these properties.
besides, as the gol standard states: limiting dilution of cells from a primary tumor when orthotopically transplanted results in neoplasm, that recaptiulate the heterogenetiy of the tumor orign.
in other words, the gioma stem cell reproduce the tumor cell types.

neuroshpere formation does not define gliomas, as the neurosphere not necessary meet the multiple cell types complexity.
heterotypic transplantation does not define gliomas, as not able to recapitulate micro environment cues.
therapy resistance does not define gliomas, as stem cell is functional definition.

## q7

mordern approach uses molecular and genetic classification.
the genomic data has shown that many muated gene are tightly correlated with the gliomas.

this reduce the problem we had with histology classification of diffuse glioma, such that histologial features are poorly correlated to molecular drivers.

the typical approach to classify the gliomas will be using markers.
one problem is, the markers are just the same markers from the normal functional cells, such as sox2, oligo2.
or, the makers are not functional defined, such as cd133.
overexpression of cd133 does not confer stem cell identity.
the other methods exist, such as using dyes.

the current classifications is a decision tree.
different marks are tested from the diffuse glioma, and test for other markers, and finally classify the gioma.

traditional classification is subjective visual decision based on histology, not using genetic testings.

# ion channel

## q8

### a https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5073621/

kcnq3

### bcde

yes, we can see there is neonatal seizures, and childhood seizures in iii4, and febrile seizures iv4.

yes, we see incomplete penetrance from iii2.
this person is a carrier, but no sympotom.

no, we dont see phenotypic heterogeneity.
at least not from this data.

no, we dont see genetic heterogeneity.

### e

genetic heterogenetiy will be yes, as the various mutations of kcnq2 produce the same phenotype.

## q9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754324/

### a

de novo

### b

maternal

### c

iii, voltage sensor

### d

missense

### a

3 questions and experiments to test:

1, what is the volatage response of the mutated channel?
culture the cell with the mutation, and use patch clamp to test the physiology properties of the single channel.

2, what is the this channel located?
and from its location, what neural function is possible affected?
use antibodies agaisnt scn2a and immunohistochemistry to stain and see the location of the channel.
from location, we can roughly have some hypothesis of what is affected.

3, what is the possible phenotype of the mutation?
we could transfect the mutation of the human gene into wild type mice, and see these mice with mutated copy of the scn2a gene will have some defect.

# AD

## q10

1, reduced ab, but not enough.
there are still to many ab plaques for the neural system to have normal function.

2, the treaments are targeting at the stage of the ad which is too late, and the cognitive aspect is not reversable.
if the treatment is given in early stages, it might be more useful.

3, the ab may not be the only important factor in later stages.
the ab is very important during the development of the disease does not mean it has to be important in the later stages.
treamtent combining reducing ab, reuce inflammation, enhance neuron protection may show a better results.

## q11 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044446/

apoe4 is a important gene that causes ad.
the normal function of the protein is a ligand in receptor mediated endocytosis of lipid and proteins.
studies have shown that apoe4 increases the ab aggregation, as the protein is a least effective aggregation inhibitor.
the protein affect both the transport and metabolism process of the ab in brain, and this not effective isoform increase the ab aggregation, decrease the ab clearance, and both pathway causes ad.

# retina

## q12

anatomy, the drug will likely reduce the abnormal vescularization on retina, less aggergate of lipid and choroid on retina, less neuron death, less synatic loss.

retinal function, with the drug, the rgc will likely to stay normal can carry out the normal functions.

vision, the drug will likely to stablelize or slow down the progress of vision loss, but it will unlikely to retore the lost vision.

introcular pressure, the drug will likely to reduce the introcular pressure, as it reduce the fragile vessels vurst, and the rgc metabolism is improved.

the local administration would be more efficient than oral.
if the drug is small lipid that is tranmitable through the sclera and chroid layer in the eye, it would be benefitial to use eye drops.
if the drug is not penetrable through the layers, such a protein or large molecule, it should be taken orally.
if the drug has side effect like causing irratations, it would be better to take orally as well.

## q13

in case that iop is high, the neurons are under stress and the the rgc around the optic nerve are dead.
this is seen in glaucoma.
well the iop is not the only risk factor, it is related to degeneration of rgc.

to model the iop, we can use injection of mixed solution of microbeads, inject the vscoelastic to push beads into the anterior chamber angle and keep beads in the eye.
with the iop model, we can add drops of the drug or put the whole model in drug solution, and testing for rgc neuron death rate.

# PD

## q14

the medelian i categroy.
the snca gene mutation is discovered to be important for this type of pd.
this is done by doing linkage analysis and gene sequencing.
looking at the pedigre, this pd is highly penetrant.

the incomplete penetrance ii.
the gba mutation is discovered to be improtant for this type of pd, by genetic analysis.
first, the population with pd has a higher chance to have gba mutation.
the heterozygous gba mutation has a higher chance to have pd, but some times they have no sympotom.

## q15

### a 

example1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5761666/

the over production of snca is a possible cause for pd.
study has shown that b2ar can modulate the snca transcroption through histone regulating pathway.
thus, when give the drug b2ar antagonist, animal model has shown less snca production and norwegians population show reduce pd risk.

exmaple2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4774255/

because gba gene codes for lysosomal enzyme which is related to lewy body build up.
drugs have been invented to bind to the misfolded protein and correct the folding and restore the normal enzyme function.
if the gba function is restored, it is likely to reduce the lewy body and relief the disease condition.

### b

the pd has several causes, and we are not very clear about them.
but, studies have shown that several genes are important of pd.
for example, a patient is with gba defect and the other gene are normal.
now, the best treatment will be use genetic theorpy to pin point the target, the gba.
drugs such as gba carriers tht can restore the gba activites can help the patient.
the other treatments are not like this effective, as they target the pd disease as a whole and not very specific.
