    # % fig: optimal solution for inverse achieved
    # % likelihood surface theta trajectory (many trajectories)
    # % bar plot, error bar showing parameters
    # % eigen vectors of hessian,
    # % covariance of hessian
    # % correlation of covariance
    # % theta varing by first eigen vector (the mattered most direction)
    # % this fig is confirmation, we can use the model as if its the monkey's brain
    # % fig: infered internal model has similar behaviors to monkeys on testdataset
    # % TODO. same trials overhead, Acceleration/color gradient velocity path, path simlar and stop similar
    # % same trials control curves
    # % example monkey error trial explained. overhead belief and mk path
