## q1

### a

transporters
receptors
signal pathways
transcription factors
ligases

### b?

by giving the drug that bind to GABA receptor, the seizure is controled.

### c

the scn1a gene is coding for sodium channel that critical to ap propagation in some interneurons.
if the patient has abnormal functional scn1a, we should not give durgs that acting on ca channels ro ampa receptors as they will have no effect.

### d

could use aav to insert the correct copy of the scn1a gene selectively to the inhibitory interneourns that need functional scn1a copy.

## q2

### a

because of the mutation in this ca channel, less ca is entering the cell and there's less ampa.
this causes less synaptic transmission and an abnormal early firing patterns.
the abnormal firing pattern will make the other neurons rebound soon after, and casuing seizures.

### b

stimulate the neurons similar as the rebound current.
and see if this rebound current is suffcient to reproduce the seizure neuron activity.

# MS

## q3?

the ms will result in plagues/lesions, inflammation, and demyleinating.
demyleinated axon, this is the initial sign of the ms.
the causes and mechanism is not fully studied, but the results is, the axon mylein sheath is breaking down.
plaques, the oligo cells are unable to fully repair the demyleinated axons, and this plaque build up during this break down of waste process.
inflammation, the immune cells is over activated and attact the myleinated axon.

the treatment is usually involve with reduce the inflammation first.
durgs of corticosteroid can reduce the inflammation.
pro, its a easy treatment, durgs can be taken orally.
con, the treatment has sides effect, and it does not act on restoring the normal function of the neural system by putting mylein back.

treatment, targeting on reducing demyleination, drugs that supress the immune system activity and reduce the immune cell level can be used to stop the progress of the ms.
with less misfunctional immune cells, less mylein is attacted and the process is slowed.
pro, the treatment can slow down the progress of the ms
con, the treatment does not restore the normal neuronal activity, as it only slow down the progess.

# TBI

## q4

### a?

3 process, axotomy, ischemia, and inflammation.

first, revascularization, we should target to restore the normal vascularization.
the revascularization will reduce the hypoxia and provide essential nutriants to the neuron for self heal process.
second, neuroprotection, we should target on preventing the neurons to suffer from secondary injury such as inflammation.
third, restore the neural function by plasicity.
the dead neurons cannot regenerate, but other neurons could take the place the dead neurons.
it is important to retrain those neurons to perform normal activities.

### q5

injury on brain has delayed injury.
injury on brain cause neuron death that is not invertiable.
injury on brai causes more complex outcomes.
injury on brain causes hypoxia, potentially.
